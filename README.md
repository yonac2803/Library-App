# Library-App

The purpose of this project is to create a library management system that allows the municipal library to keep track of its library and other publications.
The system will allow librarians to add, edit, delete and filter items based on various criteria, including author, genre and publication.
It will also allow borrowers to borrow and return books and display comments on late returns.
In addition, the system will provide daily reports on items and allow the creation of sales based on various parameters.
